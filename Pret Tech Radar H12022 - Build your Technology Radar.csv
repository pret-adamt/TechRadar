Cisco Umbrella,Assess,Tools,TRUE,"<p>Cisco Umbrella is a Cloud driven Secure Internet Gateway that provides protection from Internet based threats, for users wherever they go. Umbrella’s global network processes billions of requests per day, analysing and learning internet activity to determine where attacks are being staged, so it can block requests to unwanted and malicious destinations before a connection is even established.</p>"
Notification Webhooks (Network Monitoring),Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently in order to get it real-time. This makes webhooks much more efficient for both provider and consumer. The only drawback to webhooks is the difficulty of initially setting them up.</p>"
Flow Preference,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,<p> Flow Preference is a feature of the Meraki Auto-On VPN that allow the granular configuration of the flow of traffic over the VPN based on its attributes. The plan is to added this feature and identify if there are any benefits that could be gained from it. </p> 
VPN redundancy,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p> VPN Redundancy, simply put is having multiple VPN tunnels running across different routes concurrently this builds resilience because if one tunnel collapses the other still persists due to the divergent routing, meaning there is no interruption to service.  </p> "

BitBucket,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>BitBucket is the legacy tool used for the storage and version control of our source code, primarily in the Mulesoft space. Efforts should be made to consolidate code management into Github.</p>"
Okta,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>Okta is a secure identity cloud that links all your apps, logins and devices into a unified digital fabric. Okta has been Pret's corporate SSO solution for 3 years. While a capable platform it duplicates much of the capability provided by other tools in the emerging estate. As identity services migrate to Azure AD for all Pret employees, we should consider whether Okta is really required.</p>"
Ngrok,Hold,Tools,TRUE,"<p>ngrok is a cross-platform application that enables developers to expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. The software makes your locally-hosted web server appear to be hosted on a subdomain of ngrok.com, meaning that no public IP or domain name on the local machine is needed. Similar functionality can be achieved with Reverse SSH Tunneling, but this requires more setup as well as hosting of your own remote server. Ngrok is a very interesting tool, however we struggled to get their attention commercially, so production use cases should be avoided.</p>"
Givex,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,<p>Givex is a stored Credit provider that is currently used by Pret to manage the value assigned to a validation of loyalty card. While Givex has served its purpose we would like to move over to Eagle Eye who we currently use for Coffee subscriptions. </p>
Mulesoft,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>MuleSoft provides the most widely used integration platform for connecting SaaS & enterprise applications in the cloud and on-premise. Mulesoft has proven to be an expensive choice for Pret, both in terms of its licencing model, and our ability to source skilled engineers. Mule continues to overcome connectivity challenges in the integration space and has encapsulated platforms like Netsuite well, but further use of its toolset should be approached with caution.</p>"
Kotlin,Hold,Languages & Frameworks,TRUE,"<p>Kotlin is an open-source, statically-typed programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala, among many others. Kotlin does not aim to be unique—instead, it draws inspiration from decades of language development. It exists in variants that target the JVM (Kotlin/JVM), JavaScript (Kotlin/JS), and native code (Kotlin/Native).</p>"
ChargeBee,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>Chargebee is the subscription billing and revenue management platform that underpins our subscription offering. The tool was invaluable in bringing the offer to market and supported our first year well, but has started to creak under the strain as we scale. Chargebee's team have struggled to keep pace with our feature appetite and a few production incidents have left us feeling that it's probably time to consider the future of the platform. Given capacity, and the importance of subscription to Pret, this will be a protracted retirement but in the meantime we should consider use of native features carefully.</p>"
Braze CRM,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,<p> Braze CRM is an email marketing and customer data platform currently in use by Pret but due to be replaced by Atreemo provided by The Access Group.</p>

change control,Hold,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>Most people may see change control as an unusual concept to be but on hold. To be more specific we are putting on hold the historic change control process. In an ecosystem when CI/CD is becoming the go to approach the concept of micro-upgrades, with automated test and simple rollbacks replaces the old style of Change Requests and CAB meetings.</p>"
Azure docker,Hold,Tools,TRUE,"<p>Docker is a platform the allows of conterend application virtualistion. Pret has previously considered that as a technology for future use. However, tools like Google Cloud Run that do no require the same configuration overhead and have better and more cost effective scaling options. This leaves docker redundant on our radar.</p>"
MailJet,Hold,Tools,TRUE,"<p>Mailjet is an all-in-one solution to send, track and deliver transactional, notification and marketing emails. Use it to engage and interact with your client base via email and analyze the communication. Pret's mailjet instance has struggled with deliverability issues and support has been lacking from the mailjet team.</p>"
DDOS Protection,Hold,Tools,TRUE,"<p> DDOS Protection is hardware and software components designed to protect against Distributed Denial of Service attacks. We have put this on hold, not because DDOS attacks are not a threat but more because we should design our systems in handle DDOS attacks through the process of scaling and internal logic rather then external devices. </p>"
insightOps Logging,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>InsightOps allows you to centralize your logs from on-premises systems, the computing cloud, and in-house applications. You can organize your logs using Tags, and use InsightOps' robust Search capabilities to discover precise, contextual information about your infrastructure.

Secret Server,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,<p>Secret service is a legacy tool that we use to store usernames and passwords of service accounts used by our applications. Both GCP and Azure have their own native equivalents. As part of our move to a cloud native architecture we would migrate over to these tools when we have the chance and remove Secret Server once complete.</p>
Crush SFTP Server,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,<p>Crush is a file transfer product that we currently have installed in our on premise data centre. We are putting this to hold as moving to cloud components in Azure and GCP which provide the same functionality is more in keeping with our strategic direction.</p>
Managed SQL Server,Hold,Tools,TRUE,<p>Managed SQL service is provided on the Azure Platform. Managed SQL is not the way forward. It does however provide a mechanism to migrate existing SQL databases into the azure Platform. Nothing new should be developed on SQL Server. </p>
PRTG,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,<p>PRTG is a network and server monitoring tool. This tool is very good for monitoring on premise servers and networks. As we move into move could based solutions/platforms we should more to logging & monitoring native to those environments.</p>
SCV,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>The SCV data environment was the forerunner to Pret's customer data platform. With the migration to the azure data platform and Atreemo, it is all but defunct, but remains the source for a few reporting use cases. Every effort should be made to decommission it.</p>"
Salesforce Demandware,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,<p>Demandware is told name for what is now known as Salesforce Commerce Cloud. The current journey however is 18 clicks and should be reviewed alongside side our new digital capabilities. </p>
